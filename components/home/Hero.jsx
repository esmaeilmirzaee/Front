          Hi. This is Esmaeil MIRZAEE.
        </p>
        <p className='px-4 py-5 text-xl font-light text-justify text-indigo-800'>
          I started my journey in the field of computer and electrical
          engineering as a network engineer, which I continued the job title for
          five years. Then I continued my job as a Linux administrator for the
          next three years. During those years, I challenged every technology
          behind each device I used. I am curious enough and have an innovative
          mindset. So, I moved to the next epic in my lifeâ€”I started to educate
          myself programming languages. Consequently, my journey initiated as a
          developer. I learned how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then
          ReactJS. Next, I learned ExpressJS framework and Rust programming
          language to develop backend services.
